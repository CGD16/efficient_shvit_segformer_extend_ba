I would like to express my gratitude toward everyone who supported me during my thesis project.

\medskip

First, I would like to thank my advisor, Martin Leipert, for giving me this interesting topic and the precious opportunity to do my bachelor's thesis in the Pattern Recognition Lab at Friedrich-Alexander-University. His mentorship and suggestions during this research project have been instrumental in shaping the direction and quality of my work. His encouragement and insightful advice have been a constant source of motivation and confidence. A special mention and heartfelt gratitude to Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Maier for creating this opportunity, which allowed me to grow in the professional field.

Lastly, and most importantly, I thank my family for their constant support and encouragement. Without it, this assignment would not have been possible.

Thank you all for making this thesis possible.
